# PricePeeps — Frontend (Expo)

# 🛍️ Price Comparison App

A mobile app built with **React Native (Expo)** and a **Python (FastAPI/Flask) backend**, designed to compare product prices across multiple e-commerce platforms.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo)
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI or Flask)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL

## 🧠 Problem Solved
- Helps users find the best prices for a product by querying different platforms.

## 🧪 Project Scope
Due to the lack of public APIs from major e-commerce sites, this project uses **dummy data** to simulate real-world product listings and pricing.

The goal was to explore the architecture and logic for a working price comparison engine.

## 🚀 Features
- Search for products across platforms
- View price comparisons and seller info
- Mobile-first UI (Android & iOS)

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- Explored scraping and API limitations from commercial platforms
- Improved my full-stack development skills using Python + PostgreSQL
- Built modular components and clean API structures

## 📁 Repo Status
Demo code available — no real-time data due to lack of open APIs.

## Backend Repository

The backend for this app is located in a separate repository: [PricePeeps Backend](https://github.com/HappyAdebayo/pricepeeps-backend)
